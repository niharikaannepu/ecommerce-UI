Core Concepts Implemented

Component-Based Architecture

Global State Management using Context API

React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)

Client-Side Routing

Array Methods (map, filter, reduce)

Persistent Storage using localStorage

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone <https://github.com/niharikaannepu/ecommerce-UI.git>


Navigate to the project folder:

cd ecommerce-ui


Install dependencies:

npm install


Run the development server:

npm run dev

How It Works

Products are displayed dynamically from a data file.

Users can add products to the cart.

If a product already exists in the cart, its quantity increases.

The total price updates dynamically using JavaScript reduce method.

Cart data is stored in localStorage to prevent data loss on refresh.

Navigation between pages is handled by React Router.
